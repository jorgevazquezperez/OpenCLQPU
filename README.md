# OpenCL QPU
Project which aims to add a QPU as part of OpenCL standard.

## Current status
As for now, QPU in OpenCL is just added simulated using CPU as a device (or every other classical device desired, but in this case CPU was chosen for the execution of the examples). A limited version of QPE and Shor algorithms can be found in `samples` folder.

## Following steps
Create a QPU driver to be able to execute code using a QPU as a device.
